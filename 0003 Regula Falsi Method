--METHOD OF FALSE POSITION Or REGULA-FALSI METHOD
The bisection method guarantees that the iterative process will converge. It is,
however, slow. Thus, attempts have been made to speed up** the bisection
method retaining its guaranteed convergence. A method of doing this is called
the method of false position.
It is sometimes known as the method of linear interpolation.

--The order of convergence of the Regula Falsi method is 1.618
